It's getting popular to claim that everyone should learn coding, including President Obama and many
other celebrities. While I agree with them, the rationale for teaching everyone code is beyond finding
a job. The way of approaching software problems should have inspired, if not yet, a lot about how
we study and deliver education. Being a proficient Python programmer may not be necessary, but algorithm
thinking should be as fundamental as reading, writing and doing basic math. Not only will it make
learning a more pleasant experience, but it will also lower the cost of education. From an economic
point of view, the current education system is unscalable and unsustainable. What's the solution?
IMHO, thinking in algorithms will help us solve this problem.

I struggled in my calculus finals, and so did many of my friends. We may have resorted to Wolfram Alpha
to much when we were taking the classes, but that's a different story. At some point we deemed it ironic
that a computer can solve a math problem better than ourselves, among which many major in math. However,
now I believe that it's the way I was taught to do calculus didn't really teach me do calculus.

If I remembered correctly, we started with a few basic transformation formulas, which wasn't too hard
since they were pretty much like high school algebra. Then trigonometry functions started to confuse me
about which function I should use to tackle the problem. Then right before finals, we were taught to
use integration by parts and a few other very smart tricks, we crammed before the finals, and we returned
most of what we have learned to our dear professors 3 months after taking the course.

Shouldn't I at least remember where to look at when I need to solve a calculus problem, just like I
know to Google how to make lentil soup and step through it? I sort of did, but I couldn't find a procedure
to follow to solve the problem.

Does a procedure exist? Isn't it that we just need to very smart friend who majors in math or just use
Wolfram Alpha?

Yes, there is a procedure, and no, we can be just as smart as, at at least close to, our genius friend
or Wolfram. After you figure it out, you may think that it's not that 'smart' at all.

The second lecture of Prof. Henry Winston's Artificial Intelligence course, which is available online
from MIT Open Course Ware, explains how to do this in a systematic way.
